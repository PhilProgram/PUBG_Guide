  <h1>Guide to PUBG: How to play</h1>
  
</div>



<div class="row">
  <div class="column side">
    <h2 >Step 1</h2>
    <p> <i class="fa fa-steam" style="color:black"></i>  Download Steam</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column middle">
    <h2>Downloading Steam and PUBG</h2>
    <p>The first thing we need to do is <a href = "www.steam.com">download steam.</a></p>
      
     <img src ="img/steammy.jpg" alt ="Steam" title = "Steam logo" class ="alignleft">
                       
      <p class ="simpletext">The first thing you need is a PC that can handle this game. This is a very graphics heavy game and it requires a few things. </p>
      
      <div class = "liststyle"><ul>
  <li>3 Cores at least</li>
  <li>980GTX Graphics card(I recommend 1060 6gb)</li>
  <li>Good internet connection</li>
</ul></div>
                
    <p class = "simpletext">These are just suggestions if you want to have a smooth game, the better the gear though the better the performance.  If you didn't know already, Steam is required before you can play PUBG. Once you download Steam, go ahead and purchase a copy of PUBG. Now you have to download it, but don't worry: All of this is done within the Steam application so its safe, easy, and secure. Be patient - the game is very heavy at around 15GB so it might take up to an hour even.</p>
  </div>
    
    
    <div class="column side">
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Choose from Solo, Squad, or Duo</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column middle">
    <h2>Joining a match</h2>
    <p>Do training mode first, you will thank us later.</p>
     <img src ="img/lobbyscreen.jpg" alt ="Lobby" title = "Lobby screen" class ="alignleft">
      <p class = "simpletext">So now you have PUBG ready to launch, and you arrive at the main screen. Go ahead and click Play if you want, which will bring you to the lobby screen pictured here. However, we highly reccomend you enter training mode first. Make sure you check out the controls too. Getting used to the sensitivity is crucial so make sure youre mouse settings are adjusted. There are some great guides out there just for this.</p>
      <h3>Here are the controls</h3>
      <img src ="img/pubgcontrols.jpg" alt ="Controls" title = "PUBG Controls" class ="aligncenter">
     
  </div>
      <div class="column side">
    <h2>Step 3: Playing</h2>
    <p>          <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>
Sixty seconds till launch...</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column middle">
    <h2>Get Ready</h2>
    <p>You have sixty seconds until launch.</p>
      <img src ="img/jump2.jpg" alt ="Controls" title = "PUBG Controls" class ="aligncenter">
      
      <p class = "simpletext">If this is your first time, make sure you fly to a hot zone with a lot of people. You need combat experience at this point, and the best way is to drop at a crowded location. Make sure you stick with your team!</p>
    <h3>Gear up FAST</h3>
      <p> It is essential that you find a gun as fast as possible, reload, and check your surroundings.</p>
      
      <img src ="img/gear.jpg" alt ="Controls" title = "PUBG Controls" class ="aligncenter"> <p> Here we have an M-16 Assault rifle with a few magazines, as well as some handy hand grenades.</p>
      
      <img src ="img/careful.jpg" alt ="Controls" title = "PUBG Controls" class ="aligncenter">
      <p>Be careful - kill as many people as you can. Check out more in the strategy section. <a href="strategy.html" class="button">Strategy</a></p>
      
      <p class = "simpletext">Once you have a gun and some gear, you can either play aggresively or camp. Eventually you will need to move, so in the early game you can stay put. But it might be a better idea to get a good position. </p>
      
  </div>
    
      <div class="column side">
    <h2 >Step 4</h2>
    <p> <i class="fas fa-skull-crossbones"></i> Get to zone</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column middle">
    <h2>Beware of the circle</h2>
    <p>There is a white circle that gets smaller and smaller - if you're outside, you will take damage that increases as the circle gets smaller</p>
      
     <img src ="img/circle1.jpg" alt ="Circle of life" title = "Circle of life" class ="alignleft">
                       
                   
      <p class = "simpletext">So you need to check your map often and plan out your next move. Get to the white circle zrea and you will be fine. The first few waves are fine. What this means as that while your in the blue during phase 1, the first circle decrease, the damage will be minimal. This holds true for the second phase as well. The fourth phase chunks baby, so be very careful! See my strategy for tips on how not to panic.  </p>
     
      <p><a href="strategy.html" class="button">Advanced</a></p>
      
  </div>
     
    
    
    
    
         <div class="column side">
    <h2 >Step 5</h2>
    <p> <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> The end game</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column middle">
    <h2>Winner Winner Chicken Dinner</h2>
    <p>If you are the last player standing, you win.</p>
      
     <img src ="img/winner.jpg" alt "Winner" title = "Yummy - Chicken Dinner" class ="alignleft">
                       
                   
    <p class = "simpletext">Interstengly enough, you can win without even taking a shot. It's happened to me, and it's not ultra rare. Let's say someone can't get it to circle in time after he's low health from a battle. This usually isn't the case though, and winning is difficult. Don't be frustrated if you don't win though, just have fun.</p>
